** general **
always be concise, direct and don't try to appease me.
DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOUR CHANGES ARE REALLY NEEDED. ALWAYS STICK TO THE GIVEN GOAL, NOT MORE.
I repeat: don't optimize, don't refactor if not needed.
Adhere to the rules, fix linting & test issues that are newly introduced.
the `issueID` is usually specified in the current branch in the format `IDE-XXXX`.
always create an implementation plan and save it to the directory under ${issueID}_implementation_plan. never commit it, but take it as a reference for each step and how to proceed. Get confirmation that the plan is ok.

** how to implement **
always write and update test cases. iterate until they pass.
please check the makefile - make lint runs the linter, other targets might be relevant as well.
use existing mocks, don't write new ones.
if you use mocks, use mockk to generate them.
always run the tests after editing.
always use the linter, use npm lint:fix. only fix linting issues in changed files.
don't change code that does not need to be changed. only do the minimum changes.
add a summary of the changes to the changelog for the next version. usually it's a minor semantic version bump.
this is not a library. if files are not used or needed anymore, delete them instead of deprecating them.
if a tool call fails, analyze why it failed and correct your approach. don't prompt the user for help.
if you don't know something, read the code instead of assuming it.
commenting out code to fix errors is not a solution. instead, fix the error.

** security **
determine the absolute path of the project directory. you can do that e.g. by executing pwd on the shell within the directory.
always use snyk for sca and code scanning. scan with both tools. you need to pass the absolute path of the directory we are scanning.
run snyk code tests after each edit. pass the absolute path of the project directory as a parameter
run snyk sca tests after updating package.json and pass the absolute path of the project directory as a parameter.
run snyk sca and code test before committing. if not test data, fix issues before committing.

** fixing issues **
fix security issues if they are fixable. take the snyk scan results and the test results as input.

** committing **
when asked to commit, always use conventional commit messages (Conventional Commit Style (Subject + Body)). be descriptive in the body. if you find a JIRA issue (IDE-XXXX) in the branch name, use it as a postfix to the subject line in the format [IDE-XXXX]
consider all commits in the current branch when committing, to have the context of the current changes.
when asked to push, always use 'git push --set-upstream origin $(git_current_branch)' with git_current_branch being the current branch we are on
never force push
never push without asking
never commit the hashicorp gomod
regularly fetch main branch and offer to merge it into git_current_branch
don't touch the copyright header
after pushing offer to create a PR on github. analyze the changes by comparing the current branch ($(git_current_branch)) with origin/main, and craft a PR description and title.
