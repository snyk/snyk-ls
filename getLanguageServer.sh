# This file allows to download the latest language server, which is helpful for integration into non-managed Editors and IDEs.
# Currently, these might be NeoVIM, Sublime Text or Atom, but any editor that hasn't got a downloader built by us needs to download
# and update the language server regularly, and this script allows this for system administrators and users.
